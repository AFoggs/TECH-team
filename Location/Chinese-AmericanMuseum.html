		<h2>About the Chinese-American Museum of Chicago</h2>
        <p>The Chinese-American Museum of Chicago (CCA museum) intends to showcase the history and heritage of the Chinese immigrants as they moved to the City of Chicago. The museum originally opened in Chicago’s Chinatown neighborhood in 2005. Unfortunately, during the year of 2008, the CCA museum suffered a damaging fire. After repairs were made, the museum renovated it's space and officially re-opened in 2010.</p>
		<p>The Museum has several exhibits, including one known as “The Attic,” which is a collection of the saved treasures of local residents. The exhibits focus primarily on the exploration and display of traditional Chinese festivals, historical studies of Chinese-American immigrants, and the experiences and stories of the their communities.</p>
		<p>The museum is a private, non-profit organization, open to the public. It is a member organization of the Chicago Cultural Alliance, which is also a partner of the Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
		<p>The museum is open Tuesday-Friday from 9:30am to 2pm, and Weekends from 10am-5pm.</p>
