		<h1>Description</h1>
		<p>Ping Tom Memorial Park located along the edge of the South Branch of the Chicago River in the Armour Square Community.
		 The park was named in honor of the leading force behind its creation, Chinatown's most noted civic leader, Ping Tom (1935-1995).  
		 The park's fieldhouse, named in honor of the late Advisory Council President Leonard Louie, was completed in October 2013. 
		 Outside, the park offers an athletic field, walking paths by the river, and a boat house, which is open for kayak rentals during the summer season. 
		 The boathouse includes a public dock that is available for use by non-motorized boats during park hours. 
		 Outside facilities also include a children's playground and a pagoda-style pavilion.   
		 The park is a popular destination for special events and many of its spaces are available for rental.

		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>The Chicago Park District acquired the site for Ping Tom Memorial Park in 1991.
			 Ping Tom Memorial Park's 12-acre site was originally a Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad yard located along the edge of the South Branch of the Chicago River. 
			 In 1998, the Chicago Park District began transforming the old rail-yard into a beautiful rolling green space, taking full advantage of impressive river views. 
			 In 2002, the Chicago Park District acquired 5 additional acres on the northeast side of the park. 
			 Later of 2002, landscape improvements to the expanded area of Ping Tom Memorial Park will soon follow.</p>

	<h1>Something about Ping Tom</h1>
	<p>
			Ping Tom formed the Chinese American Development Corporation in 1984. 
			The private real estate firm transformed a 32-acre rail yard site into Chinatown Square, a $100 million dollar residential and commercial expansion of Chinatown. 
			Active in numerous prominent civic and cultural institutions, Ping Tom was also an advisor to U.S. senators, Illinois governors, and Chicago mayors.
